Dataset Overview

The datasets used in this project are sourced from the MoleculeNet platform, a widely recognized benchmark for molecular machine learning. Specifically, we utilize the following datasets: bace,bbbp,clintox,esol,estrogen,freesolv,lipo,metstab,tox21

For each dataset, we use three splits based on scaffold clustering. These splits divide the data into training, validation, and test sets. The specific splits used in this project are provided by the authors of KPGT (Knowledge-Propagated Graph Transformers).
